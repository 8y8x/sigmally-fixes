# Sigmally Fixes
Version control and issue tracking for Sigmally Fixes (a performance client for Sigmally.com), available on GreasyFork
[here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/483587).

I use this repo to sync changes between my laptop (dev) and PC (testing).
I don't necessarily need to keep my commits private, and I wanted to implement version checking in a way that couldn't
log IPs or other usage, hence I made this repo public.

If you'd like to reach out, contact me on Discord (@8y8x). Don't make a pull request.
